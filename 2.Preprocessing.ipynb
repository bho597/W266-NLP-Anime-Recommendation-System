If you like horror and/or trash even then i woudn't recommend this to you. All the love you feel in the Mangapages is non existing in this lazy adaptation. This Anime recreates the panels of the manga almost perfectly, but with a poor artstyle and lazy CGI. At no times i felt the same horror when reading the manga, only the horror of wishing it would end already. This is just a huge waste of time and i hope the works of Junji Ito get one day the adaptation it deserves.\",\n          \"I want to preface this review by saying I watched this anime thinking that it was a merely an episode zero for a longer anime series and not a prequel to a live action movie and because of that I don\\u2019t really hold a bias for it being good or bad depending on how I felt about the movie. So I can only judge the OVA and nothing else. Let\\u2019s begin, shall we? -CHARACTERS In the terms of the characters, Shiroishi(MC) is the only one that kinda stands out. All the other characters were pretty one dimensional and stayed that way throughout the entirety of the OVA. The bullies were dicks, his friend betrayed him, his parents didn\\u2019t seem to care that much about him, his parole officer and love interest(I don\\u2019t know what else to call her) just wanted to use him, essentially everyone in the OVA is pretty much a dick to Shiroishi. Shiroishi is the only character that seems to have any development whatsoever when he snaps and turns into a sadistic murder machine who gets off on killing people. So the characters were pretty bland, but Shiroishi does redeem it partially because of his interesting transition and his internal battle with his feelings. -STORY The story is nothing to write home about. If you want to know what it is about, you can go read the synopsis. The story didn\\u2019t take any surprising turns and pretty much followed how I thought it was going to play out after I got a read on the mood. From the little research I did on the movie, it looks like the stories do connect with the mobster that Shiroishi is sent to kill. The story was alright at best, didn\\u2019t really make me feel anything. Felt like the did some things just for the shock, but I guess that is a major reason why you would watch this OVA though. -ART/ANIMATION The animation seemed pretty normal for the time. It really hasn\\u2019t aged that well and the parts where Shiroishi has machine punches or kicks is kind of a disconnect. The art is much worse. All the character designs seem just plain ugly, especially some of the faces that they make. Some the characters in the dojo scene looked like children with the faces of adults, which made for a good laugh. Still, the art is pretty bad. The gore isn\\u2019t shown that much and when it is, it\\u2019s not that great. If you want to watch an anime for the gore porn, there are better choices than this. -MUSIC I actually liked the music in this OVA. The use of Shiroishi\\u2019s vocal clips in the opening/ending reminded me of the This Is Sparta remixes. The background music did it\\u2019s job and added to the scene, it might of been a little overbearing at times. -FINAL THOUGHTS I would pass this OVA up unless you watched the movie and wanted some backstory or you wanted to see how it compared to the manga. It was bad and just felt like a waste of time. While I didn\\u2019t really like the OVA, I am kinda interested in what the movie is like, so it is good in that respect. If you came for gore, you should go elsewhere.\",\n          \"This is my first and probably only review I will ever make and please, trust me on this review... Let me get started with a few things, the story is complex and very realistic, it is kinda messed up as in f***ed up. But nonetheless it was superb and very nice. so It got a 9/10 The art, I dont like this kind of art for this kind of anime, I like SAO and that kind of art, so it got a 7/10 based off of biasedness The sound, lets not bullshit, it was really good and most of it fit really well. 9/10 Enjoyment would have been a 10 if not for the story and my hater for 1 of the characters Overall it is a 10. PLEASE HEAR ME OUT Many of you will hate this review because you think I am crazy. Well, I am not, I am a 20 year old med school student who loved romance anime and this anime put my principals and ethics to the test. This anime was made by someone with a deep psychological understanding of relationships. Im not really into psychological but this anime was amazing. It will be a hit or miss for you, either you will love it or hate it. I loved it. It is hard to explain the plot without giving spoilers so thats why I am cutting this short. Many people are fanboy haters, well, this anime is actually rather amazing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

If you like horror and/or trash even then i woudn't recommend this to you. All the love you feel in the Mangapages is non existing in this lazy adaptation. This Anime recreates the panels of the manga almost perfectly, but with a poor artstyle and lazy CGI. At no times i felt the same horror when reading the manga, only the horror of wishing it would end already. This is just a huge waste of time and i hope the works of Junji Ito get one day the adaptation it deserves.\",\n          \"I want to preface this review by saying I watched this anime thinking that it was a merely an episode zero for a longer anime series and not a prequel to a live action movie and because of that I don\\u2019t really hold a bias for it being good or bad depending on how I felt about the movie. So I can only judge the OVA and nothing else. Let\\u2019s begin, shall we? -CHARACTERS In the terms of the characters, Shiroishi(MC) is the only one that kinda stands out. All the other characters were pretty one dimensional and stayed that way throughout the entirety of the OVA. The bullies were dicks, his friend betrayed him, his parents didn\\u2019t seem to care that much about him, his parole officer and love interest(I don\\u2019t know what else to call her) just wanted to use him, essentially everyone in the OVA is pretty much a dick to Shiroishi. Shiroishi is the only character that seems to have any development whatsoever when he snaps and turns into a sadistic murder machine who gets off on killing people. So the characters were pretty bland, but Shiroishi does redeem it partially because of his interesting transition and his internal battle with his feelings. -STORY The story is nothing to write home about. If you want to know what it is about, you can go read the synopsis. The story didn\\u2019t take any surprising turns and pretty much followed how I thought it was going to play out after I got a read on the mood. From the little research I did on the movie, it looks like the stories do connect with the mobster that Shiroishi is sent to kill. The story was alright at best, didn\\u2019t really make me feel anything. Felt like the did some things just for the shock, but I guess that is a major reason why you would watch this OVA though. -ART/ANIMATION The animation seemed pretty normal for the time. It really hasn\\u2019t aged that well and the parts where Shiroishi has machine punches or kicks is kind of a disconnect. The art is much worse. All the character designs seem just plain ugly, especially some of the faces that they make. Some the characters in the dojo scene looked like children with the faces of adults, which made for a good laugh. Still, the art is pretty bad. The gore isn\\u2019t shown that much and when it is, it\\u2019s not that great. If you want to watch an anime for the gore porn, there are better choices than this. -MUSIC I actually liked the music in this OVA. The use of Shiroishi\\u2019s vocal clips in the opening/ending reminded me of the This Is Sparta remixes. The background music did it\\u2019s job and added to the scene, it might of been a little overbearing at times. -FINAL THOUGHTS I would pass this OVA up unless you watched the movie and wanted some backstory or you wanted to see how it compared to the manga. It was bad and just felt like a waste of time. While I didn\\u2019t really like the OVA, I am kinda interested in what the movie is like, so it is good in that respect. If you came for gore, you should go elsewhere.\",\n          \"This is my first and probably only review I will ever make and please, trust me on this review... Let me get started with a few things, the story is complex and very realistic, it is kinda messed up as in f***ed up. But nonetheless it was superb and very nice. so It got a 9/10 The art, I dont like this kind of art for this kind of anime, I like SAO and that kind of art, so it got a 7/10 based off of biasedness The sound, lets not bullshit, it was really good and most of it fit really well. 9/10 Enjoyment would have been a 10 if not for the story and my hater for 1 of the characters Overall it is a 10. PLEASE HEAR ME OUT Many of you will hate this review because you think I am crazy. Well, I am not, I am a 20 year old med school student who loved romance anime and this anime put my principals and ethics to the test. This anime was made by someone with a deep psychological understanding of relationships. Im not really into psychological but this anime was amazing. It will be a hit or miss for you, either you will love it or hate it. I loved it. It is hard to explain the plot without giving spoilers so thats why I am cutting this short. Many people are fanboy haters, well, this anime is actually rather amazing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"favorites_anime_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35381,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[4657]\",\n          \"[6880, 30503, 20507, 22199]\",\n          \"[1, 1535, 853, 11061, 33489, 3588, 28171, 5114, 2904, 30831]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["shuffled_users = users.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","train_users, test_users = train_test_split(shuffled_users, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","test_users, val_users = train_test_split(test_users, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)"],"metadata":{"id":"qlVqhdKTRM8W","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712887999022,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Brendan Justin Ho","userId":"04205927048132746041"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_users.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"hjngdVKfSAIr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712887999935,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":915,"user":{"displayName":"Brendan Justin Ho","userId":"04205927048132746041"}},"outputId":"220c8c42-cfec-4d6e-912b-5e97335f78e8"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["              profile                                               text  \\\n","42293  ItachiHatesYou  Don't watch this.

After watching all of the episodes however, I change my mind. Plot: 2/10 There's so many plot holes. Who create such game? Who is the mastermind behind all these chaos? What exactly makes Rachel Gardner so special? None of my many questions were answered even after I have watched the entire episodes. The plot is ridiculously unrealistic in terms on how the characters react to different situations. What is the goal of this anime? I can't see it. Gore elements? None. Sure there's blood here and there but it's nothing gory, nothing worth gasping or chilling over. Characters: 2/10 Holy, I hate Rachel's character the most. Her character is boring, typically cold, mysterious main character who has no goal in life and is so overly obsessed with the concept of dying in the name of God. Which is ridiculous considering she is one of the sinners. Isaac's character is shallow though kind of interesting. With the amount of blood he loses between episode 8 to 11, I think he probably should've died. The priest's character is not explained well it got me confused. All in all, I couldn't love even one single character in this anime. Over all: 2/10 I felt like I wasted so many times watching all episodes of this anime. I keep on waiting and waiting for it to surprise me, to entertain me, even just a little, I keep on giving this anime a chance. But it's... just so disappointing. Not recommended at all.\",\n          \"I am kinda surprised that people wrote bad reviews for this show. To be honest, I am really enjoying this show out of all the ones that are out in this season, even with shows that I follow like Azur Lane, Oresuki etc etc. The reason would be that this show is very very easy to pick up, especially if you're having a bad day or just went through some tough time at  work or school, as what an anime should be, a peace of mind and a break from everyday life. The show is very light hearted and features an isekai element, a form of escapism that everyone would desire, and with a very happy vibe that resonates throughout the show. We see the OP of the anime where it shows the characters would spend good times with each other and mishaps along the way but would still be in a positive attitude. Despite being an isekai, whilst the many other isekais already here these past few seasons, this one sets itself apart for having a show that has it's light hearted and comical moments but does not stop itself from implicating seriousness in the events that takes place and how the characters react to such serious situations around them. It's a light comedy show yes, but it pulls you in it's realism through the seriousness of the situation it's set in. I understand that most light novel readers said it's a butcher of the souce material, well, of course it is! If you've only got 12episodes of a whole series of books, it would definitely have some cuts here and there. In that stand point, I don't think its fair to judge the anime itself by how much source material was cut from the source material. The novel is the novel, the anime is the anime. It might not be what you'd expect, but at least you got to see it animated and they did their best to satisfy us fans. I'd take it as effort and look at what they did good in their work! If you're ever looking for an Isekai that will let you run from your own world and into a more vibrant and joyful one, but doesn't dull your palette with repititive and constant mindless jokes, this show would be for you. It's sometimes unsuspecting yet realistic situations would pull you in! Try the first episode! I hope you'll enjoy it!\",\n          \"To be quite frank, the first season was a lot better. At least you had more interaction, but here everything just becomes awkward and distant. Expect a lot of confusion and I'm-Going-To-Pull-My-Hair-Out moments. I stayed up until almost three in the morning watching the episodes, convinced that something was going to happen. It turned out to be a huge waste of time.

There, in order to survive the eventual arrival of the \\\"Dusk End,\\\" the people devoted their efforts to rediscover and recreate lost alchemic technologies. Rediscovered technology from the past era was gathered in the alchemy research city known as \\\"Central,\\\" where research was conducted on how to halt the advance of the twilight.       One of the heroes is a young man who researched alchemy in Central, the other a girl living in a small town on the frontier. This girl's name is Escha. In the process of using her knowledge of ancient alchemy to help others, she was assigned to the Development Department. The young man's name is Logy. Having learned the newest alchemic techniques in Central, he requested a transfer to this understaffed town to make use of his abilities, and meets Escha when he is assigned to the Development Department as well. The two make a promise to use their alchemy together, and bring success to the Development Department.
